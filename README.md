ISYS 320U - Assignment 01 Conference Travel Decision Analysis  

This project investigates the trade-offs involved in choosing travel options to attend a conference. The analysis explores factors such as travel costs, time, and other relevant considerations to support a decision-making process. 

The goal of this assignment is to determine what travel approach makes the most sense for attending a conference, considering cost, distance, and other measurable factors. This analysis helps simulate real-world decision scenarios using Python and data visualization.

Within the notebook you will find visualization outputs and interpretive discussion that explores:

Which travel option minimizes cost

Time vs. cost trade-offs

Recommendations based on defined decision criteria

Refer to the publication of results in the notebook for the complete breakdown
